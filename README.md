# njs-oauth2-sequelize-express

This project is based on this article https://blog.logrocket.com/implementing-oauth-2-0-in-node-js/ it's an implementation of oAuth 2 with express, sequelize, mysql and node-oauth2-server.

Make a copy of config.env.example and name it config.env, complete the env variables with your mysql server info, run npm i and then node src/index.js

Then you can use the same examples in the article.
